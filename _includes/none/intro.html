<p>
Deep learning includes machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks. Deep-learning architectures have been applied to computer and machine vision, natural language processing, bioinformatics, drug design, and medical image analysis. This training will feature examples of Deep Learning with Keras/Tensorflow. Training will use Python environments and the R reticulate package within RStudio. Final questions and resources for continued learning will be provided.
